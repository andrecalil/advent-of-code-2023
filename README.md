# Advent of Code 2023

**SPOILER ALERT**

This repo contains my solutions for each of the [AoC 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges (that I've solved so far...).

By no means these are _the only_ possible solutions - and **definitely** not the best ones.

AoC is a super fun way to exercise some nuances of logic that we rarely find on our day to day coding.

To end on a quote:

Happy coding!
